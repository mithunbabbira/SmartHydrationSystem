## Title
I built an IoT “hydration enforcer” after kidney stones (and it actually worked)

## Post (copy/paste)
I’m the kind of person who can forget water exists.

That “skill” got me **kidney stones** and **high hemoglobin** (18.7). I tried the usual fixes—apps, reminders, willpower—nothing stuck.

So I did what any reasonable engineer would do: **I built a machine to bully me into hydration.**

How it works:
- Detects whether I’m home by **checking my phone’s Bluetooth presence**
- Every **defined interval**, it checks if my bottle’s weight dropped (did I *actually* drink?)
- If not, it escalates: **LEDs → display alert → buzzer**
- If I try to cheat (pick up / put back), it knows. **No weight change = no mercy**
- When I drink: quick **green “victory lap”** + consumption shown on the display

Bonus: it plugs into my broader home dashboard because apparently I can automate everything except drinking water.

If you’re building quirky IoT projects (or fighting your own “basic human needs” backlog), I’d love to hear what you’ve automated.
