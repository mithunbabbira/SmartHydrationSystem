# Hydration System – Video Voice-Over Script

Use this text for your voice-over when recording the hydration system demo video.

## Scene 0: The Problem (Quick Intro Clip)

"So… I’m the kind of person who can forget water exists. I don’t really feel thirsty, and on a “good” day I’ll drink like 500 ml max.

That genius strategy gave me kidney stones, and my hemoglobin came back at 18.7—apparently my blood was running “concentrate mode.”

So I built a solution instead."

---

## Scene 1: System Overview

"This is my hydration system—designed , 3D printed and programmed .

At the heart of it is a weighing unit that constantly measures the bottle weight. And you’ll see two sets of lights: one below the table, controlled via IR, and one behind the pegboard—a Bluetooth LED strip."

---

## Scene 2: The 30-Minute Check

"Every 30 minutes, it does checks if I home? and  did the bottle weight drop by at least 100 milliliters? If not… it’s reminder time."

---

## Scene 3: The Reminder – Lights and Buzzer

"When the reminder starts, the light under the table and light under bottle starts flashing , pegboard LEDs go red 


the alert system  startssss now  and the tiny display under the monitor shows the aler too .

After 5 seconds, the buzzer joins in to make sure I’m definitely paying attention."

---

## Scene 4: Smart Response – Pick Up the Bottle

"If I pick up the bottle, the buzzer stops instantly.

But if I try to cheat—just pick it up and put it back—it knows. No weight change, no drink. So it’ll remind me again."

---

## Scene 5: Drinking Confirmed – Celebration

"When I actually drink and put the bottle back, it measures the new weight.

If it confirms I drank, both light zones turn green for a few seconds—like a tiny hydration victory lap. And the small display below the monitor shows how much I’ve consumed."

---

## Scene 6: The Dashboard

"I also built a dashboard so I can control all my IoT stuff in one place—because if I’m going to overbuild, I’m going to overbuild consistently."

---

## Scene 7: The Results (Outro)

"It actually worked—after a few days my hemoglobin went from 18.7 to around 16.

Turns out I don’t need motivation… I need LEDs to bully me."

"So… I’m the kind of person who can forget water exists. I don’t really feel thirsty, and on a “good” day I’ll drink like 500 ml max. That genius strategy gave me kidney stones, and my hemoglobin came back at 18.7—apparently my blood was running “concentrate mode.” So I built a solution instead.

This is my hydration system—designed and 3D printed because apparently I need engineering to do what a cactus can. At the heart of it is a weighing unit that constantly measures the bottle weight. You’ll also notice two sets of lights: one below the table, controlled via IR, and another behind the pegboard—a Bluetooth LED strip. I won’t go into the communication details—just know both respond to the system.

Every 30 minutes, it does a check. First, it checks if my phone is present at home. If I’m home, it then checks whether the water level has dropped by at least 100 milliliters. If not—meaning I haven’t had a drink—the system triggers a reminder.

When the reminder starts, the light under the bottle begins flashing and the pegboard LEDs flash red. After 5 seconds, the buzzer joins in to get my attention.

When the buzzer is going off, if I pick up the bottle, the sound stops instantly. But if I try to cheat—just pick it up and put it back—it knows. No weight change, no drink. So it’ll remind me again.

When I actually drink and place the bottle back, the system measures the new weight. If drinking is confirmed, both the lights below the table and the lights behind the pegboard turn green for a few seconds. The small display below the monitor shows how much water I’ve consumed.

I’ve also built a dashboard to control all the IoT devices in my house—lights, displays, sensors, and more—all from one place.

It actually worked—after a few days my hemoglobin went from 18.7 to around 16. Turns out I don’t need motivation… I need LEDs to bully me."
