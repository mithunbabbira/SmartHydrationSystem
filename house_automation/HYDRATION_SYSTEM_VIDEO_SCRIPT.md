# Hydration System – Video Voice-Over Script

Use this text for your voice-over when recording the hydration system demo video.

## Scene 1: System Overview

*[Show the hydration setup]*

"This is my hydration system. At the heart of it is a weighing unit that continuously measures the weight of the water bottle. You'll also notice two sets of lights: one below the table, controlled via IR, and another behind the pegboard, a Bluetooth LED strip. I won't go into the communication details—just know both respond to the system."

---

## Scene 2: The 30-Minute Check

*[Explain the reminder cycle]*

"Every 30 minutes, the system runs a check. First, it checks if my phone is present at home. If I'm home, it then checks whether the water level has dropped by at least 30 milliliters. If not—meaning I haven't had a drink—the system triggers a reminder."

---

## Scene 3: The Reminder – Lights and Buzzer

*[Show lights flashing, then buzzer]*

"When the reminder starts, the lights below the table begin flashing, and the lights behind the pegboard flash red. After 5 seconds, the buzzer joins in to get my attention."

---

## Scene 4: Smart Response – Pick Up the Bottle

*[Demonstrate picking up the bottle]*

"When the buzzer is going off, if I pick up the bottle, the sound stops instantly. But here's the clever part: if I try to fool the system by just picking up the bottle and putting it back without drinking, the system notices. No weight change means no drink—and it will alert me again."

---

## Scene 5: Drinking Confirmed – Celebration

*[Show drinking, placing bottle back, and celebration]*

"When I actually drink and place the bottle back, the system measures the new weight. If drinking is confirmed, both the lights below the table and the lights behind the pegboard turn green for a few seconds. The small display below the monitor shows how much water I've consumed."

---

## Scene 6: The Dashboard

*[Show the dashboard]*

"I've also built a dashboard to control all the IoT devices in my house—lights, displays, sensors, and more—all from one place."
